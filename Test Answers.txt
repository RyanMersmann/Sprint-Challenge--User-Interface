1. Semantic HTML is the form and structure that one must adhere to when writing your HTML. A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to the developer and the brower that the end users will use it on. This includes using tag that give the content meaning like <header>, <footer>, <p>, etc. These tags define the contact that is being listed on the page clearly without the developer having to put much effort in to find out where and what it is being used for.
2. Display block displays an element as a block element like <p>. It starts on a new line and takes up the whole width whereas inline displays an inline element on the same line as the previous element and any hegih and width properties don't take effect.
3.Content, Padding, Border, and Margin.
4. The cross axis
5. Git is valuable to developers because it allows them to track the progress and changes in one place. This prevents confusion and overwriting other's code. It is also useful because of it's branching capabilities. This faciliates the feature branch workflow popular with many Git users.
